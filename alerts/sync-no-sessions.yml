      **Report this immediately to support.**

      No sync sessions have been created in the last 30 minutes.

      This could indicate:
      - Sync service is down or not running
      - Network connectivity issues
      - Database connection problems
      - All facilities are offline

      Last sync session was created at: {{ rows[0].last_session_created if rows[0].last_session_created else 'Unknown' }}

      **Immediate action required:**
      1. Check if sync service is running
      2. Verify database connectivity
      3. Check facility network status
      4. Review system logs for errors
