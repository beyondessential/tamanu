      **Report this immediately to support.**

      One or more facilities have not had a successful sync in the last hour.

      This could indicate:
      - Sync service is down or not running
      - Network connectivity issues
      - Database connection problems
      - Specific facilities are offline
      - Sync sessions are failing with errors

      **Facilities with no recent successful syncs:**
      {% for row in rows %}
      - Facility ID: {{ row.facility_id }} - Last successful sync: {{ row.last_successful_sync }}
      {% endfor %}

      **Immediate action required:**
      1. Check if sync service is running
      2. Verify database connectivity
      3. Check facility network status
      4. Review system logs for errors
      5. Check if sync sessions are failing (look for sessions with errors)
