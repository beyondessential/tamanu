# Patient resources IPS button

## Can I hide the International Patient Summary button?

- There is no toggle in the Tamanu settings or facility configuration to hide the International Patient Summary option inside **Patient resources**.
- The button only appears for accounts that have the International Patient Summary permission; if your administrator removes that permission from your role, the button disappears automatically.
- If you need it hidden, ask an administrator to remove the permission for your account or role. There is no way to turn it off yourself from the patient view.
