// When adding more scopes here, you need to consider:
// - this is an early feature and we don't have all the corner cases worked out
// - currently devices that don't have a scope in database, and request it, get kicked out
// - so if you add a scope here, and then add it to the client side, locally that might
//   work fine, but then in production you might be accidentally creating something that
//   kicks out every single already logged in device that now requests that scope
//
// So it's kinda on you to figure out the new behaviour and its edge cases, and eventually
// we'll all work together to figure this thing out! ðŸ¤ž
