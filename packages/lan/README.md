# Tamanu LAN server

This is the main server that the [Tamanu desktop app](https://github.com/beyondessential/tamanu-desktop)
communicates with.  It stores data in a local filesystem which syncs to
a [remote server](https://github.com/beyondessential/tamanu-server).

Setup and configuration instructions can be found in the [main README file](../../README.md).

## Running

Start the server with `yarn run start-dev`.
