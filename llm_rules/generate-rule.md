# Process

- Look through the chat history for the current chat
- Produce a new .md file into the `llm_rules` within the root of the project (so it can be committed to version control)
- Summarise any relevant context into a "# Context" section
- Produce a set of steps for each of the most common actions the user has been asking to perform. Put these in a "# Process" section
- Include any learnings about anti-patterns or places it went wrong to avoid in an "# Avoid" section

# Avoid
