# Context

This rule is for creating documentation that captures successful workflows and patterns discovered during LLM-assisted development sessions. When you've had a productive conversation with an AI assistant that resulted in solving a complex problem, implementing a feature, or establishing a good workflow, you should create a rule to preserve that knowledge for future reference.

This is especially valuable for:

- Repeatable development patterns that work well in your codebase
- Complex multi-step processes that involve multiple tools or files
- Solutions to common problems that might recur
- Workflows that have specific gotchas or requirements
- Any process where you've learned what NOT to do through trial and error

The goal is to turn successful one-off conversations into reusable documentation that can guide future development work.

# Process

- Look through the chat history for the current chat
- Produce a new .md file into the `llm_rules` within the root of the project (so it can be committed to version control)
- Summarise any relevant context from the conversation into a "# Context" section
- Produce a set of steps for each of the most common actions the user has been asking to perform. Put these in a "# Process" section
- Include any learnings about anti-patterns or places it went wrong to avoid in an "# Avoid" section
- Add a "# Recent Updates" section at the end for tracking changes over time
- **ALWAYS end the rule with a critical reminder section** using this exact format:

  ```markdown
  ---

  # ðŸ”´ CRITICAL REMINDER: UPDATE THIS RULE AFTER USE

  **After completing any [TASK_TYPE] task using this rule, you MUST update this file with:**

  1. **New patterns** discovered during the session
  2. **Gotchas or anti-patterns** encountered
  3. **Better approaches** that improve existing steps
  4. **Edge cases** not previously covered
  5. **Corrections** to existing guidance that proved incorrect

  **Add an entry in the "Recent Updates" section above with the session date and learnings.**

  **This step is MANDATORY and cannot be skipped!**
  ```

  _(Replace [TASK_TYPE] with the specific type of task the rule covers, e.g., "translation", "refactoring", "testing", etc.)_

# Avoid

- Leaving out critical information
- Forgetting to include the Self-Update After Usage section in new rules
- Creating rules that are too vague about when they should be updated
- Not documenting what specific learning triggered an update

# Notes

See an example of the output at `./translate-hardcoded-strings.md`

Rules should be living documents that improve over time through actual usage, not static documentation that becomes outdated.
