{% docs fhir__table__encounters %}
FHIR data about encounters.

"Encounter" means an interaction between a patient and a healthcare provider, for health services or
when assessing the health status of the patient. Encounters are in the present and the past; future
interactions are typically called "Appointments."

These are materialised from `public.encounters`.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__encounters__status %}
The status of the encounter.

In Tamanu this can be one of two values:
- in-progress (for current or open encounters)
- discharged
{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__encounters__class %}
The general classification of the encounter.

This is a complex type but in Tamanu represents only one of these three classes (or absent):
- IMP (inpatient)
- EMER (emergency)
- OBSENC (observation)
{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__encounters__actual_period %}
The start and end (if present) dates of the encounter.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__encounters__subject %}
Reference to the patient involved in the encounter.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__encounters__location %}
The location of the encounter.

This is a complex type which encodes many bits of information about the location, such as its name
and internal ID, physical type, and status. Additionally there are two locations per encounter, one
describing the ward or general hospital area, and one describing the bed or specific place within
that area.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__encounters__service_provider %}
Reference to the facility where the encounter is taking place.
{% enddocs %}
