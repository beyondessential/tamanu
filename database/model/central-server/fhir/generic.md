{% docs fhir__generic__schema %}
Contains materialised FHIR resources.

FHIR resources in Tamanu are generated ("materialised") from the source tables in the public schema.
This materialisation process collapses the relational database model into a flatter hierarchical
resource model, according to the FHIR specification. Tamanu's FHIR API is then implemented as a thin
query and presentation layer on top of this materialised data. Every top-level field in a FHIR
resource that we support is expressed as a column in the corresponding FHIR resource table. Scalar
data is expressed directly, and complex data is encoded as JSONB.
