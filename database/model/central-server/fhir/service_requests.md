{% docs fhir__table__service_requests %}
FHIR data about service requests, which cover both laboratories and imaging.

<https://www.hl7.org/fhir/servicerequest.html>
{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__service_requests__identifier %}
Two identifiers:
- The Tamanu internal UUID of the lab or imaging request.
- The Tamanu Display ID of the lab or imaging request.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__service_requests__status %}
The processing status of the request as a normalized string.

Possible values: `draft`, `active`, `on-hold`, `revoked`, `completed`, `entered-in-error`, `unknown`.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__service_requests__intent %}
The intent of the request.

This is meant to encode planned/proposed requests, but Tamanu doesn't yet have this concept, so it
is always the single value `order`.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__service_requests__category %}
The SNOMED category of the request.

- Always 363679005 for imaging
- Always 108252007 for laboratory
{% enddocs %}

{% docs fhir__service_requests__priority %}
The priority of the request, normalized.

Tamanu priorities are fully customisable, to accommodate a wide range of clinical practices.
However this means there is no obvious way to map priorities to the FHIR set. It is an
administrator's reponsibility to ensure the set of priorities in a Tamanu deployment matches usage.
As a stopgap, Tamanu priorities which do not match one of the FHIR priorities (`routine`, `urgent`,
`asap`, `stat`) are encoded as `null`.
{% enddocs %}
