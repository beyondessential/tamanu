{% docs table__patients %}
The central record for a patient.

⚠️ The full contents of this table are synced to all devices, and in larger deployments this may be
hundreds of thousands of records (or even millions), so it is critical to keep the row size small.

Only contains basic patient data (name, dob, etc.): the bare minimum to be able to find that patient
in the system from the search page.

The remainder of the patient data is stored in the `patient_additional_data` table, which is only
synced to a device once it has marked that patient for sync (in the `patient_facility` table).
{% enddocs %}

{% docs patients__display_id %}
Tamanu identifier for patients that is used on the front-end to refer to a patient.

It is usually the primary "health system" ID for this patient (ie something like a medicare number,
national healthcare number, etc), and may be imported from an external system or allocated by Tamanu
itself.

Informally this is called NHN or "Display ID" interchangeably.

Additional external IDs are tracked in the `patient_secondary_ids` table.
