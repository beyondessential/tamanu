- `SA`
- `SU`
{% enddocs %}

{% docs appointment_schedules__nth_weekday %}
Ordinal weekday for monthly recurrence interpreted with `days_of_week` for example:

- `2` with `days_of_week = ['TU']` =  Second Tuesday of the month
- `-1` with `days_of_week = ['FR']` = Last Friday of the month
{% enddocs %}

{% docs appointment_schedules__occurrence_count %}
When this value is set, the recurrence ends after generating the specified number of occurrences
At least one of `occurrence_count` or `until_date` must be set.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs appointment_schedules__is_fully_generated %}
Whether or not all repeating appointments have been created for a schedule
