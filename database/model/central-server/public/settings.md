{% docs table__settings %}
Shared and synced configuration values.

Always set from the Central server / Admin interfaces and then synced to facilities.

Those can change dynamically when a server/client is up, some settings are read at point of use and
so change is applied "immediately", some settings are read once at server start but those should be
rare and eventually eliminated as there's no facility within Tamanu to restart its own servers.
