{% docs table__survey_responses %}
A response to a survey (as recorded by a practitioner).

Typically surveys are filled on behalf of patients as part of an encounter.

Because there are multiple distinct kinds of dates at play here:
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` are system data for syncing and cannot be relied on for realtime
- `start_time`, `end_time` are real datetimes automatically recorded when starting and submitting a survey response
- in survey response answers, there could be a data element for targeting the date of when exactly the data is recorded in real time.
