{% docs table__certifiable_vaccines %}
Table of scheduled vaccines which can be certified via EUDCC or ICAO VDC.

Introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, these are standards which can be
used to produce a QR code containing vaccine information and a digital signature
which certifies that the vaccines were administered by a competent authority.

This table both contains additional information about scheduled vaccines which is
required for those to be certified, and signals that the vaccines listed may be
included in certification QR codes.

See also the signers table.
