# What's this for? (devs)

Update existing documentation when you discover new information about areas of the codebase.

# Context

Use this rule when you need to update existing context documentation with new insights about how parts of the codebase work together.

# Process

- Identify which existing context document in `llm/docs/` needs updating
- Review the current content to understand what's already documented
- Add new insights about relationships, dependencies, or patterns
- Update any outdated information about data flow or component interactions
- Maintain the existing structure while adding new sections if needed

# Avoid

- Duplicating information that's already well-covered
- Removing context that's still relevant

# Notes

- Use Australian/NZ English spelling and terminology when updating context documentation
