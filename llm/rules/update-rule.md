# Context

Use this rule when you need to update an existing rule based on new learnings or improved processes discovered during development sessions.

# Process

- Identify which existing rule in `llm/rules/` needs updating
- Review what's changed or what new insights have been gained
- Update the relevant sections while maintaining the existing structure
- Add new process steps or avoid items based on recent experience
- Ensure the rule remains actionable and specific
- Use "you" language to address the AI agent directly (not "the agent" or "the LLM")

# Avoid

- Completely rewriting rules unless the process has fundamentally changed
- Adding generic advice that doesn't come from actual experience

# Notes

- Use Australian/NZ English spelling and terminology when updating rules
