# Context

Use this rule when you need to update existing documentation based on new information discovered during development.

# Process

- Identify which existing document in `llm/docs/` needs updating
- Review the current content to understand what's already documented
- Update the relevant sections with new information
- Maintain the existing structure and tone
- Add new sections if needed, following the established format
- Ensure all links and references are still valid

# Avoid

- Completely rewriting documentation unless absolutely necessary
- Removing useful information without good reason

# Notes

- Use Australian/NZ English spelling and terminology when updating documentation
