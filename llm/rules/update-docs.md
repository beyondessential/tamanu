# Context

Update existing documentation when you discover new information about areas of the codebase. Use this when you need to add insights, correct outdated information, or expand existing documentation rather than creating new documentation.

# Process

- Identify the existing document in `llm/docs/` that needs updating
- Read the existing document to understand current content
- Update following the same structure as documented in `generate-docs.md`
- Include specific examples and code snippets for new information
- Link to relevant files using relative paths for new components mentioned

# Avoid

- Removing existing information without verifying it's actually outdated
- Adding duplicate information that's already well-covered
