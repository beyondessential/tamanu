# Context

Use this rule when creating new documentation for the Tamanu project. This could be technical documentation, user guides, or process documentation.

Focus on creating comprehensive, useful documentation that serves both current team members and future contributors.

# Process

## For New Documentation

- Identify the topic and target audience (developers, users, administrators, etc.)
- Create a clear, descriptive title
- Structure the document with these sections:
  - **Overview**: Brief explanation of what this covers
  - **Prerequisites**: What users need to know or have set up first
  - **Main Content**: Step-by-step instructions, explanations, or reference material
  - **Examples**: Practical examples where helpful
  - **Related Areas**: Links to related documentation or code
  - **Undocumented Areas** (only if relevant): Brief mention of related functionality that exists but isn't covered
  - **Useful Commands**: Relevant commands or shortcuts
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Link to relevant files, functions, or other documentation
- Test any instructions or code examples before publishing

## For Updating Existing Documentation

- Read through the existing content first
- Identify what needs to be updated, added, or removed
- Maintain the existing structure and tone unless there's a good reason to change it
- Update any outdated information
- Add new sections if needed, following the structure above
- Ensure all links and references are still valid

# Avoid

- Creating documentation that's too technical for the intended audience
- Writing walls of text without clear structure
- Including outdated information or broken links
- Forgetting to include practical examples
- Making assumptions about what readers already know

# Notes

- Use Australian/NZ English spelling and terminology throughout documentation
