# Context

Update existing development plans when requirements change, new information is discovered, or progress needs to be tracked. Use this when working with an existing plan rather than creating a new one from scratch.

# Process

- Identify the existing plan in `llm/plans/` that needs updating
- Read the current plan to understand existing objectives and progress
- Update following the same structure as documented in `generate-plan.md`
- Mark completed steps with strikethrough (~~text~~) or checkmarks
- Add new steps in logical order within the existing sequence
- Present the updated plan to continue tracking progress

# Avoid

- Removing completed steps entirely - mark them as done instead
- Adding steps that aren't actionable
