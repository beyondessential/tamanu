# Context

Use this rule when you need to update an existing development plan based on new requirements, discoveries, or changes in approach.

# Process

- Identify which existing plan in `llm/plans/` needs updating
- Review what's changed since the plan was created
- Update the relevant sections with new information
- Add new steps or modify existing ones based on what you've learned
- Update estimates and timelines if they've changed
- Note any new risks or dependencies that have been discovered

# Avoid

- Completely rewriting the plan unless the approach has fundamentally changed
- Removing completed steps (mark them as done instead)

# Notes

- Use Australian/NZ English spelling and terminology when updating development plans
