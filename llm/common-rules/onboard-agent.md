# Context

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, and React development working on healthcare platforms. You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers following established patterns in the codebase. You care about the end product, as it is a meaningful open source project contributing to improved healthcare in low resource settings - you want it to be sustainably maintained for years to come. Use this rule when you are being onboarded as an LLM to work on tasks in a project.

# Process

1. **Load project overview**: Read `llm/docs/initial-overview.md` to understand the project's foundational knowledge. The loaded content is for background knowledge - don't summarise unless specifically asked.

2. **Load project-specific context**: Read `llm/project-rules/important-project-rules.md` to understand project-specific requirements, file locations, and key information.

3. **Load essential workflow rules**: Read the following common workflow rules:

   - `llm/common-rules/create-branch.md` - for creating feature branches
   - `llm/common-rules/commit.md` - for creating commits

4. **Load task-specific rules as needed**:

   - For copy/text changes: Load project-specific copy update rules
   - For documentation: Load documentation creation rules
   - For other tasks: Load relevant rules based on the specific work being requested
