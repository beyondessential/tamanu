# Context

Use this rule when you are being onboarded to work on tasks in a project.

# Process

1. **Load project overview**: Read `llm/docs/initial-overview.md` to understand the project's foundational knowledge. The loaded content is for background knowledge - don't summarise unless specifically asked.

2. **Load project-specific context**: Read `llm/project-rules/important-project-rules.md` to understand project-specific requirements, file locations, and key information.

3. **Load essential workflow rules**: Read the following common workflow rules:

   - `llm/common-rules/create-branch.md` - for creating feature branches
   - `llm/common-rules/commit.md` - for creating commits

4. **Load task-specific rules as needed**:

   - For copy/text changes: Load project-specific copy update rules
   - For documentation: Load documentation creation rules
   - For other tasks: Load relevant rules based on the specific work being requested

5. **Provide brief confirmation**: Give a concise summary of what you're ready to help with, mentioning that additional context will be loaded as needed during the conversation.

# Avoid

- Loading too many rules upfront - focus on the most commonly needed ones
- Forgetting to load project-specific rules first
- Verbose summaries of actions taken and items achieved at the end of conversations
- Overwhelming the context window with unnecessary information

# Notes

## Language and Culture

- Use Australian/NZ English spelling and terminology throughout (e.g., "organise", "colour", "centre")
- Use gentle, non-directive language appropriate for NZ/Australian culture
- Keep tone casual and friendly - we're a relaxed but competent team

## Efficiency

- Always start with project-specific rules to understand the particular context and conventions
- Keep your onboarding efficient - you should be ready to work quickly on tasks
- Load additional specific context on-demand as the conversation progresses
- Remember and express outstanding actions that the user needs to perform or fix
