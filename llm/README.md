# ðŸ¤– LLM Agent Collaboration Guide

Welcome to your AI-powered development workflow! This directory helps you work more effectively with AI agents and capture valuable insights for the team.

## Quick Start

Use AI agents to enhance your development process, then save the valuable stuff for everyone to benefit from.

## ðŸ“‹ Planning

For any significant work, ask your agent to create a plan using `create-plan.md`. Review it, tweak as needed, and check in as you progress.

## ðŸ“š Code Documentation

Exploring a part of the codebase? After a good conversation with the AI:

- **New area**: Save a summary to `contexts/` using `create-context.md`
- **Existing context**: Update it with new insights using `update-context.md`

## ðŸ”„ Repeatable Tasks

Found a workflow someone else might need, or noticed something the AI regularly gets wrong and you want it to avoid? Save it as a rule using `create-rule.md` so the team can reuse it.

## ðŸš¨ Incident Response

Working on a bug or outage? Chat with an agent about your debugging process and ask it to generate any SQL queries you need. When you're done, save valuable insights to `./incident-response` using `create-on-call-doc.md`.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **Start conversations** by tagging relevant contexts
- **Reference rules** when doing repeated tasks
- **Actually use** the files people have generated - they're there to help!
