## Security Features

### Current Password Verification
- You must enter your current password to prove your identity
- This prevents unauthorised password changes if someone gains access to your session

### Strong Password Requirements
- The system enforces comprehensive password strength rules
- This helps protect your account from unauthorised access

### Cross-Server Synchronisation
- Password changes automatically sync between facility and central servers
- You can log in with your new password on any connected server

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Current password is incorrect"**
- Double-check you're entering your existing password correctly
- Ensure Caps Lock is not accidentally enabled
- Try typing your password in a text editor first to verify

**"Password does not meet security requirements"**
- Check that your password includes all required character types
- Ensure it's at least 8 characters long
- Use the requirement checklist to see what's missing

**"Passwords must match"**
- Ensure the "New Password" and "Confirm New Password" fields are identical
- Check for extra spaces or hidden characters

**"Failed to change password"**
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page and attempting again
- Contact your system administrator if the problem persists

### Password Strength Tips

**Creating Strong Passwords:**
- Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and special characters
- Consider using a passphrase with numbers/symbols
- Avoid common dictionary words or personal information

**Example Strong Password Pattern:**
- `MySecure2024!` (combines words, numbers, special chars)
- `Coffee&Code123` (memorable phrase with requirements met)

## Privacy and Security

### Data Protection
- Your current password is never stored or transmitted in plain text
- New passwords are securely hashed before storage
- Password changes are logged for security auditing

### Session Management
- Changing your password does not log you out of current sessions
- You'll continue working normally after the password change
- Future logins will require your new password
