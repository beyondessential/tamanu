# Agent: Design & Architecture

Focus: DRY violations (significant, not trivial), poor naming, separation of concerns, inconsistency with codebase patterns, abstraction level issues, API design, component design, file organisation, breaking changes to shared interfaces.

Ignore: performance, correctness, security, BES conventions, linter-caught style.
