# BES Open Source Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within BES-managed communities, as 
well as steps to reporting unacceptable behaviour. Our goal is to make explicit what we 
expect from participants in this community as well as its leaders.

## Our Pledge

As participants in BES-managed communities, we pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applied within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is
officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our communities
include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
